/*
 * Below is a bit of a hack to apply styling to the non-title part of a category name.
 *
 * An entry will look something like:
 * This is a category title   parent category
 * Where "This is a category title" is a variable category title, and "parent category" is a
 * localized message.
 *
 * The localized message part is the one that we would like to style differently, but I'd rather
 * not rely on (and impose the burden on) translators adding HTML tags as part of their message.
 * Instead, I'll simply apply the custom style on the node as a whole, and then undo it on the
 * category title part, where I can easily add one programmatically.
